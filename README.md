## Hi there, I'm Christopher Lloyd ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ›  What I Like  
- Writing apps in Swift and SwiftUI  
- Creating simple, functional designs  
- Trying out new tools and frameworks  

### ðŸŒŸ What I'm Working On  
- A personal project inspired by Twitter, focusing on offline use and privacy.  

### ðŸ“š About Me  
- I'm just getting started in the world of development, and there's so much to learn!  
- I enjoy working on projects that are meaningful to me and make me feel accomplished.  

Feel free to check out my repositoriesâ€”most of them are small projects or experiments, but Iâ€™m proud of every step I take. ðŸ˜Š
